  <h1>About Me</h1>
</header>

<p>
  I am a physical and computational chemist working at the interface of quantum mechanics and chemical theory. I use advanced electronic structure methods and computational algorithms to understand and predict complex chemical phenomena.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently a faculty member at <span>Northwestern University</span>, where I pursue research and teach courses in theoretical and computational chemistry. My interests span electronic structure theory, excited-state dynamics, and accurate computational modeling of chemical systems.
</p>

<p>
  I completed my Ph.D. in Chemistry from <span>[Your PhD Institution]</span>, where I worked with <span>[Your Advisor’s Name]</span> on developing and applying new quantum chemical methods. Earlier, I earned my bachelor’s degree in <span>[Your Undergraduate Field]</span> from <span>[Your Undergraduate Institution]</span>.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy collaborating with experimental groups to apply computational insights to chemical problems, and I am passionate about mentoring students and contributing to the broader scientific community.

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am a theoretical and computational chemist with research interests at the
      interface of <strong>quantum chemistry, chemical physics, and electronic-structure theory</strong>.
      My work focuses on developing and applying advanced quantum-mechanical
      frameworks to understand electronically excited states, resonances, and
      non-Hermitian phenomena in molecular systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed my doctoral research at <strong>IISER Kolkata</strong>, where I was deeply involved
      in the development of <em>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</em> and
      <em>Time-Dependent DFT (TDDFT)</em> methodologies. I was the lead developer of
      <strong>InDFT</strong>, an in-house electronic-structure code for atoms and molecules,
      contributing low-scaling approaches for estimating fundamental gaps and
      modeling charge-transfer excitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following my PhD, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at
      <strong>TIFR Mumbai</strong>, where my research centered on the theoretical
      characterization of <em>negative ion resonances</em> using non-Hermitian
      Hamiltonians, complex absorbing potentials, and orbital-dependent
      exchange–correlation functionals.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently a research fellow at <strong>Northwestern University</strong>,
      where my work explores <em>auto-ionizing excited states</em> and their accurate
      description within modern quantum-chemical frameworks. More broadly,
      I am interested in bridging methodological developments with experimentally
      observable phenomena, particularly in spectroscopy and ultrafast dynamics.
